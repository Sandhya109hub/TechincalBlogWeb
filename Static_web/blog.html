      <p>What is blockchain technology?
        Blockchain technology is an advanced database
         mechanism that allows transparent information sharing within a business network. A blockchain database stores data in blocks that are linked together in a chain. The data is chronologically consistent because you cannot delete or modify the chain without consensus from the network. As a result, you can use blockchain technology to create an unalterable or immutable ledger for tracking orders, payments, accounts, and other transactions. The system has built-in mechanisms that prevent unauthorized 
        transaction entries and create consistency in the shared view of these transactions.</p>

      <h2>Arteficial Intelligience</h2>
      <h5>AI, Sep, 2022</h5>
      
     
      <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of 
        computer science concerned with building smart machines 
        capable of performing tasks that typically require human 
        intelligence. While AI is an interdisciplinary science with 
        multiple approaches, advancements in machine learning and deep 
        learning, in particular, are creating a paradigm shift in virtually
         every sector of the tech industry. </p>

      <h2>Virtual Reality</h2>
      <h5> Dec 17, 2023</h5>
      <p>Virtual reality is a simulated 3D 
        environment that enables users to explore and interact with a virtual surrounding in a way that approximates reality, as it is perceived through the users' senses. The environment is created with computer hardware and software, although users might also need to wear devices such as helmets or goggles to interact with the environment. The more deeply users can immerse themselves in a VR environment -- and block out their physical surroundings -- the more they 
        are able to suspend their belief and accept it as real, even if it is fantastical in nature.</p>
